# System Architecture Overview

The AT-AT system adopts a **microservices-inspired modular architecture** designed to support independent development, scalability, and maintainability. The system consists of clearly separated logical components, each responsible for a specific function.

## Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- Built with React.js.
- Responsible for rendering the user interface.
- Sends requests to the API for scans, report generation, and user authentication.

### 2. API Layer (JS Express API)
- Acts as a middleware between frontend and backend processing.
- Performs user session validation, RESTful request parsing, and dispatches tasks to Python backend.

### 3. Processing Layer (Python Backend)
- Executes scanning logic, report generation, and vulnerability detection.
- Communicates with the API layer through internal HTTP calls.
- Reads environment variables for secure credentials.

## Architectural Justification

The separation into distinct layers follows microservices principles to support:

- **Scalability**: Each component (Frontend, API, Backend) can be deployed or scaled separately.
- **Maintainability**: Isolated codebases reduce complexity when updating or testing.
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one layer (e.g., backend processing) do not bring down the UI or authentication.

> Note: No direct communication occurs between the frontend and the backend processor â€” all traffic is routed through the API layer.

## Non-Technical Notes

- This architecture is **technology-independent** in concept.
- It may be deployed to Docker, virtual machines, or dedicated servers, without altering the structural design.
- Quality Attributes (QAs) such as **performance**, **modularity**, and **reliability** are enhanced by this separation of concerns.
